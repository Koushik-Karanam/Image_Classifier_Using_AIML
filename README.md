# Simple Image Classifier

Beginner-friendly image classifier built with PyTorch and CIFAR-10.
An image classifier is an ML model that recognizes objects in images. We can build image classifiers by feeding tens of thousands of labelled images to a neural network. Tools like PyTorch train these networks by evaluating their performance against the dataset.
Let's build an image classifier that detects planes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. We'll download a dataset, configure a neural network, train a model, and evaluate its performance.
